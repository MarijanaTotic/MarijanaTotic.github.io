This is a test. computational linguist based at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de). My work focuses on language structure and linguistic diversity, with a particular interest in syntax, typology, and language evolution. My expertise lies in South American languages and Role and Reference Grammar (RRG), and I have been conducting research on South American languages, including the development of databases, corpora, and descriptions. I love good [coffee](https://espressocoffeeguide.com), Amazon (the forest), and the [Cerrado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado).

I am currently doing fieldresearch in Central Brazil, studying two languages from different language families. One of these communities is working with me on a language revitalization project, which I am actively involved in.

At the University of Tübingen, I teach courses on language structure and linguistic diversity, drawing on my research to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the field. I am passionate About sharing my knowledge with others and inspiring the next generation of linguists.
